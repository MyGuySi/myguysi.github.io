      <h1>Three months in</h1>
      <p>9 May 2019</p>
    </header>

    <p>It’s been a while since I wrote my last post and I’m coming to the end of my first 3 months at Prodigi, so to celebrate I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on the past few months.</p>

    <p>It’s been a whirlwind. From the day I started at Prodigi it feels as though I haven’t stopped, moving from one task to the next, trying to uncover the various pieces that make up the company and the service we provide. For those who don’t know (probably everyone), Prodigi is a primarily a tech company that provides a print-on-demand service, integrating with print labs around the world (including a few of our own). Our main products are our software tools for merchants - an API, a web app and a Shopify integration (coming soon).</p>

    <p>I joined as a UX designer - the first full-time designer in the company to be precise. It’s been a great start because everyone I’m working with understands the value of good design and taking a user-centred approach to product development. The development team are keen to learn and have some interesting ideas for solving problems. The difficult part has been trying to figure out what we’re missing and leading the change that needs to happen to get us to where we want to be. As a sole-designer it’s difficult to cover all of the ground at once so I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to give my attention to.</p>

    <p>I’ve been trying to read everything I can, searching for enlightenment about how I should approach bringing design into a company that historically hasn’t given it the attention it deserves. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a criticism of what came before me. The work that’s been done so far is great and has laid the foundations for building a genuinely excellent service. What has to come next though is an understanding of the role that design plays in product discovery and development (that isn’t just painting beautiful UIs) and a shift to engage with our users to learn how they think and really understand their needs.</p>

    <p>I’ve been here 3 months and I’m still trying to figure out what value I’ve created so far. Of course, there’s only so much you can do in such a short space of time and my intention has never been to jump in and change everything from the get-go; that’s usually more destructive and isn’t a great way to build trust. Instead it’s been a period of discovery, figuring out where I fit in to the current structure and slowly pushing at the boundaries and exposing the rough edges. One of those rough edges is user research.</p>

    <p>As I write this I am a little disappointed at how slow I’ve been to implement user research methods and build out our knowledge of our users. That said, I feel I’ve made more progress within the last week than the previous few months by building a list of key success metrics and starting to run user interviews and testing sessions. I’m a classic introvert so I’m way outside of my comfort zone. You might ask then, why have I pursued a career in UX design? I really enjoy speaking to people because when I’ve done so I’ve almost always learnt something new. It’s just that it doesn’t come naturally to me and I feel anxious during the build-up to a session. I don’t think that will ever change but hopefully I’ll learn to embrace it and build confidence in my own ability to lead a session with someone I’ve never met before.</p>

    <p>I’ve written previously about imposter syndrome and it’s definitely at play again now, but it also feels a little different this time. Previously I’ve been a lead mobile developer so even though I lead my own project I still folded into a team of other developers. Now I’m in a new position shouldering the responsibility for an entire discipline within the company. I’m a design-team-of-one so I don’t have the pressures that come with having to lead a team but I’m also missing the support and reassurance that what I’m doing is actually the right thing.</p>

    <p>I realise this is getting depressing quickly so I just want to highlight this point before I sign off. One thing I’ve noticed from working in a few different teams is that it’s really easy to slip into a mindset of relying on assumptions. Now of course, in the very early stages when you don’t have any users then yes, assumptions are a valid place to start, but I think the goal should be to validate those assumptions as quickly as possible. One of the ways I’m trying to make sure we’re focusing on the right assumptions is with root cause analysis (5 Whys). Now if you’ve never practiced this before then it’s incredibly frustrating; It can feel like someone is questioning everything you’re saying. Of course that’s not what is happening but it’s quite a big mental shift to make. As designers we live to ask questions and I think it’s a fundamental characteristic that is needed for us to be good at our jobs. Luckily I work with some really smart people who are open-minded and already understand the value of asking questions. However, trying to institutionalise this kind of thinking so that it becomes part of our culture is really difficult and without other designers to act as evangelists on a daily basis it’s going to be a long process of change. I’m confident that we’ll get there though.</p>

    <p>We’ve already made great strides in the few months since I joined and as I already mentioned, everyone is keen to learn and there are no big egos (except my own) which is half the battle.</p>

    <p>Anyway, enough with the sob story. I’ve got a great opportunity to grow and learn from experiences that I would never have had if I’d joined a large company. Here’s to the next 3 months… probably how long it’ll take me to write the next post.</p>
