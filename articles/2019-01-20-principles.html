      <h1>Principles</h1>
      <p>20 January 2019</p>
    </header>

    <p>This started out as a list of my personal design principles but ended up including things that aren’t unique to design that I should practice daily.</p>
    
    <h2>Form is function</h2>
    <p>We judge things by the way they look, it’s an unavoidable fact of life. If it doesn’t look usable or inviting then it probably isn’t. Simplify complex systems with clean and minimal but functional design. Remove as much as necessary and no more.</p>
    
    <h2>Remember the human</h2>
    <p>It’s easy to get carried away with statistics, conversion rates and optimising funnels only to forget that we’re designing for real people. Don’t be unethical in the pursuit of yet another target.</p>
    
    <h2>Understand the problem</h2>
    <p>Don’t get carried away by solutions and deliverables. If we’re not focusing on solving the right problem then it’s pointless. Before drawing a single pixel take a step back and ask “what problem are we trying to solve?”. Sometimes there’s a better solution.</p>
    
    <h2>Reach for perfection, settle for good enough</h2>
    <p>There is always something that can be improved and we should try to do our best work but we can’t give our best every time. Knowing when to stop and say “that’s good enough for what we’re trying to achieve” is important.</p>
    
    <h2>Question everyone but respect expertise</h2>
    <p>You’ll never know the full picture but the more you know the more informed your decisions will be. Don’t assume that anyone else has all of the answers but respect those who know more than you about a particular subject.</p>
    
    <h2>You know more than they do</h2>
    <p>If someone questions you, don’t take it personally. They may not share your point of view or be missing an important piece of information. Explain things calmly and compassionately.</p>
    
    <h2>Know when to ask questions and when to take a guess</h2>
    <p>Keep asking questions and validating assumptions until you feel you know enough to take a guess. If you get it wrong don’t be afraid to go back to ask more questions.</p>
