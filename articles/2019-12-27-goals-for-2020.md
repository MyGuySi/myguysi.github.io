title: Goals for 2020

I’m not really a fan of New Years resolutions because I never stick to well defined goals.
However, I thought I’d take this opportunity to reflect on the past year and jot down some broad goals to aim for over the next year.
I’m not going to track progress. If I don’t follow through on something then it probably wasn’t that important to me.

## Do more

* Go outside and make memories with my family.
* Spend quality time with my wife.
* Write regularly (considering weeknotes).
* Practice building products.

## Do less

* Read books/articles constantly searching for some missing knowledge.
* Eat sugary foods

## Continue

* Reduce social media usage.
