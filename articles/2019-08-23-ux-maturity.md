Imagine, you’re a new and ambitious UX designer on a mission to bring user experience design to the world. You’ve read Don Norman so you decide to join an exciting company as their first designer, ready to usher in a new era of product innovation lead by design thinking. Armed with the teachings of Steve Krug you recruit a swathe of users, run usability tests and identify their biggest pain points. You evangelise UX design within your organisation, gaining the support of engineers and managers alike. With the customer insights you’ve gathered your team starts building new features that your customers love. KPIs, engagement and revenue all increase proving the value that design contributes to an organisation. The design organisation grows as design thinking spreads through cross-functional product teams, empowering more people to capitalise on the new opportunities and insights uncovered. Life is good for a UX designer.

Yeah, that’s not how it happens…

It’s easy to fall into the trap that as an advocate of user centred design you should be pushing for everything at once. It’s admirable but consider it from your colleagues’ perspective. They’ve probably heard of the term ‘user experience’ by now and may even understand some of the core ideas, but engineers work in a very different domain, one that is focused on building technical solutions and systems rather than talking to users and understanding their needs. All of a sudden a designer is telling them to change their entire perspective on product development.

Organisational change is hard, especially very early on in your career. It’s one thing to get verbal acceptance of your ideas but you won’t get real buy in until people are willing to give you their time and attention.

I recently came across the idea of UX maturity models. Here’s one from the Nielsen Norman Group. The idea is that organisations can be divided into different stages of UX maturity. All organisations have to go through the same stages in sequential order. Some progress quicker than others. Some may start at a higher level (particularly prevalent in modern startups with a design co-founder). However, when progressing through each stage an organisation cannot skip ahead. Doing so will result in slower progress and more friction because the foundations have not been laid by earlier concepts. The change defined at each stage must be adopted before progressing to the next.

I’m not sure how much faith I really put in these anecdotal models but it seems sensible to me and Nielsen Normal Group are a respectable and experienced organisation, so I trust their insight more than most.

Suddenly it all made sense. I’ve personally tried so hard to push the perfect UX design strategy with all of the processes, activities and outcomes only to encounter resistence and ultimately failure of adoption. Of course it has to be a gradual adoption, it seems so obvious now. What the maturity model gives me is a roadmap for UX adoption. If I can work out which stage an organisation is currently at then I can see what is required to reach the next stage. That gives me a much narrower goal to focus on and a gradual path for adoption.

It will take time but we’ll get there in the end, one stage at a time.
