## About me

I started out as a developer but quickly became interested in the other skills needed to build products that people would want to use. This led me to UX and product design, and now I’m applying that knowledge alongside my experience as a developer to build tools and services.

I’ve mainly worked at startups with a brief spell contracting so I’m used to working in an environment of uncertainty and not having all of the answers handed to me on a plate. I think it’s important to stay curious and always ask “why?”.

I try to constantly question what I know so that I can continue learning. This extends into product development. Each project should have a clear hypothesis to focus research and development so that we’re not just shipping features but actually improving the experience.

In my spare time I run <a href="https://devwales.com">Dev Wales</a> which aims to help developers in Wales discover meetups and companies.
